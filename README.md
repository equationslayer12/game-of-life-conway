The Game of Life is played on an two-dimensional rectangular grid of cells.
- Each cell can be either alive or dead.
- The status of each cell changes "generation" (each turn of the game),
- depending on the statuses of that cell's 8 neighbors.
- Neighbors of a cell are cells that touch that cell,
- either horizontal, vertical, or diagonal from that cell.

## Controls
- `left click` - place an alive cell (draw)
- `right click` - kill a cell
- `space` - toggle automatic generation iterations
- `r` - Reset the board
